# Discord Bot Base
## About
DiscordBotBase is an unofficial framework written in TypeScript for [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), it allow you to create a discord's bot with the minimum of lines.

I have never used another framework, so i'm writing this one only with my ideas and "what i think useful".

## Features
- [x] Startup and global options
- [x] Register simple commands (from files only)
- [x] Error handling
- [ ] Hot reload (only commands)
- [ ] Run multiple commands at the same time
- [ ] Commands groups, alias
- [ ] Web interface
- [ ] Langs (FR/EN)

If you have any ideas, i am open!

## Installation
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) with `npm install -g typescript`.
3. Execute `npm install` where you have the `package.json`.

## Set-up first project
1. Execute the npm script `watch` with `npm run-script watch` or use directly `tsc -p src`.
2. See the `tests/` folder, you need to replace needed values by yours.
3. Run your project with:
```sh
$ node tests
```
