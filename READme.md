# Discord Bot Base
## About
DiscordBotBase is an unofficial framework written in TypeScript for [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), it allow you to create a discord's bot with the minimum of lines.

I have never used another framework, so i'm writing this one only with my ideas and "what i think useful".

## Features
- [x] Startup and global options
- [x] Register simple commands (from files only)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Hot reload (only commands)
- [ ] Run multiple commands at the same time
- [ ] Commands groups, alias
- [ ] Web interface
If you have any ideas, i am open!
